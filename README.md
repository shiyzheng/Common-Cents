<h1>Common Cents</h1>

Common Cents is a financial literacy webapp designed to teach personal finance to high school and college students using material that is more relevant at the current stage of their life compared to other personal finance resources. 

It is designed to be a Duolingo-style app with gamification (points/achievements, bright colors and animation, leaderboards, with more planned!). We reinforce spaced-repetition learning by employing a system that tailors more advanced quizzes in each topic to pull more/less from our question base

We currently have 4 topics (Introduction, Saving, Spending, and Managing Credit), complete with a total of 2000+ custom-created questions and study guides for each unit/topic, curated by UPenn's Wharton School of Business professors to ensure alignment with the National Standards for Personal Finance Education (CEE/Jump$tart).
